## Short Description ðŸ“‹

The my-auto.ge clone is a React project that emulates the functionalities of the original car marketplace website, my-auto.ge. The website renders car listings as cards, allowing users to filter and sort the data based on various search parameters.


## Features âœ¨
Filter the extensive car listings with ease! Our platform allows you to narrow down your search based on various criteria, including:

- Brand Name: Select your favorite car manufacturer to explore their available models.
- Model Name: Find specific car models that suit your preferences.
- Price Range: Set your desired budget and discover cars within that range.
- Mileage: Search for cars based on their mileage to find the perfect fit for your needs.
- Date: Sort the listings by date to see the most recent additions.
- Sell/Rent: Easily differentiate between cars available for sale and those offered for rent.
